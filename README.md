Chalo, let's get you set up with this awesome **Audio Transcription and Accent Classification Streamlit App**! It's super cool, you see, it can listen to what you say from a YouTube link or an audio file and then tell you not just what you said, but also which accent you're speaking in!

---

### **What This App Does, Yaar!**

This Streamlit app is like your personal accent detective. You can upload an audio file (WAV or MP3, anything works!) or even paste a YouTube link, and it'll do its magic. First, it makes sure the audio is just right (16kHz mono WAV, no worries about the technical stuff!), then it uses this fancy **Whisper model** to write down everything that's said. And the coolest part? It then tries to guess your accent, whether it's **American, British (that posh RP one!), Australian, Indian, or even Scottish!**

### **What You'll Need, Bhaiya!**

Before you start, make sure you have a few things ready. Think of it like preparing for a good chai session!

* **Python:** Make sure you have **Python 3.8 or newer**. Just type `python --version` in your command prompt to check.
* **RAM:** At least **4GB RAM** is a good idea, especially for the Whisper model. More is always better, like having extra samosas!
* **Disk Space:** You'll need some space for temporary audio files.
* **FFmpeg:** This is a crucial one, like the ginger in your chai! It helps with handling audio.

    * **For Ubuntu/Linux:** Just open your terminal and type these commands:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
        ```
    * **For macOS (if you use Homebrew):**
        ```bash
        brew install ffmpeg
        ```
    * **For Windows:** You'll need to **download it from ffmpeg.org** or use Chocolatey (`choco install ffmpeg`). And don't forget to **add FFmpeg's `bin` directory to your system's PATH**. You can verify it by typing `ffmpeg -version` in your command prompt.

### **Getting Started (Installation), Arey Waah!**

Alright, let's get this app on your system!

1.  **Python and FFmpeg:** First, make sure you've got Python 3.8+ and FFmpeg installed and ready to roll, as we just discussed.
2.  **Download the Project:** You'll need to **clone or download this project** to your computer. Once you have it, navigate into the project's directory in your terminal.
3.  **Install Python Packages:** Now, open your terminal in the project folder and run this command. It's like gathering all the ingredients for your recipe:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit yt_dlp librosa soundfile numpy transformers
    ```
    (Or you can create a `requirements.txt` file with these packages listed one per line and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4.  **Keep Files Together:** Just make sure all the important files (`download_audio.py`, `preprocess_audio.py`, `accent_classifier.py`, and `main.py`) are in the **same directory**.

### **How to Run This App, Boss!**

It's super easy to get this app up and running:

1.  **Start the App:** In your project directory, just type this command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
2.  **Browser Magic:** A new browser window will magically open up with the Streamlit interface.
3.  **Choose Your Input:**
    * You can **upload a WAV or MP3 file** directly.
    * Or, if you prefer, **paste a YouTube URL**.
4.  **Process and Chill:** Click the "**Process Audio**" button, and let the app do its thing. It'll process the audio, transcribe it, and then tell you about the accent.
5.  **See the Results:** You'll see the transcribed text, the classified accent (with confidence scores!), and a nice summary of the accent analysis. Sometimes, if no specific keywords are found, it might even show you a probability distribution for different accents.

### **Important Notes, Dosto!**

* Don't worry about temporary files; the app creates them and then cleans them up automatically.
* The Whisper model might take a little while to load, especially the first time or if you have a big audio file. Be patient, like waiting for a delayed train!
* Make sure you have a good internet connection, especially for YouTube downloads.
* If something goes wrong, check the Streamlit interface for error messages, and double-check your FFmpeg installation.

### **Troubleshooting, Koi Tension Nahi!**

Facing a small hiccup? No tension, we've got you covered:

* **FFmpeg not found:** Reconfirm that FFmpeg is installed and added to your system's PATH. Just type `ffmpeg -version` to verify.
* **Module not found:** Make sure all the Python packages are installed correctly. You can check by running `pip list`.
* **Large audio files:** If it's taking forever, try using shorter audio clips or, if you have a powerful machine, that helps!
* **YouTube download issues:** Ensure the YouTube URL is correct and accessible. If you're still having trouble, check the `yt_dlp` documentation for more advanced options.

This project is for educational purposes only, built with amazing open-source libraries. Just make sure you're cool with YouTube's terms of service when downloading audio.

**So, what audio are you going to try first, my friend? Let's classify some accents!**
